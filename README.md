# Project Title - Promptekey

A platform for creating and sharing AI prompts.

This project is a platform that allows users to create and share AI prompts. It features a home page where users can see a list of all posts and search for prompts by keyword, which can be in the username, tag, or prompt itself. Users can also click on a tag to search for it. The profile page shows all the posts created by the user, and allows them to delete or edit their posts. Users can also view other users' profiles by clicking on their username or image on the home page.

## Code Showcase

This project showcases my skills in Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. 
- Next.js 14 is used for server-side rendering, routing, and API routes.
- React is used for building the user interface.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application.
- next-auth is used for handling user authentication.
- MongoDB and Mongoose are used for storing and managing users and prompts.
